## üöÄ Getting Started

### For New Projects

1. **Start with Phase Templates**: Use `WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES.md` as your primary guide
2. **Plan Transitions**: Reference `PHASE_TRANSITION_QUICK_GUIDE.md` for smooth handoffs
3. **Understand the System**: Read `WORKFLOW_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` for context
4. **Choose Your Methodology**: Review `METHODOLOGY_DETAILS.md` for approach selection

### For Existing Projects

1. **Assess Current State**: Determine which phase you're in
2. **Organize Files**: Implement the system from `FILE_ORGANIZATION.md`
3. **Set Up Monitoring**: Use guidance from `FLOW_ANALYSIS.md`
4. **Establish Gates**: Implement transition checkpoints

## üìã Quick Reference

### Phase Flow
```
Research ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Maintenance
```

### Key Deliverables by Phase
- **Research**: Requirements document, technology assessment, risk matrix
- **Architecture**: System design, implementation plan, test strategy
- **Implementation**: Working code, tests, documentation
- **Testing**: Test results, performance report, security assessment
- **Deployment**: Live system, operational docs, training materials
- **Maintenance**: Monthly reports, maintenance logs, improvements

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Complete All Outputs**: Every phase must deliver its required outputs
2. **Validate at Gates**: Use transition checklists religiously
3. **Document Everything**: Future maintainers will thank you
4. **Get Approvals**: Stakeholder sign-off before phase transitions
5. **Continuous Learning**: Update templates based on experience

## üîß Integration with gh-guided-dev

These documentation files are designed to work seamlessly with the gh-guided-dev package:

- **Templates** guide the workflow structure
- **Monitoring** automation handles GitHub integration
- **File Organization** ensures clean project structure
- **Methodology** provides flexibility for different project types

## üìñ Best Practices

1. **Don't Skip Phases**: Each phase builds on the previous one
2. **Customize Templates**: Adapt to your project's specific needs
3. **Use Version Control**: Track all documentation changes
4. **Regular Reviews**: Update templates based on lessons learned
5. **Team Training**: Ensure everyone understands the workflow

## ü§ù Contributing

When updating these documentation files:
1. Maintain template consistency
2. Update cross-references
3. Test templates on real projects
4. Document changes and rationale
5. Update this README if structure changes
