### 2. Lean Startup - Detailed Analysis

#### AI-Enhanced Build-Measure-Learn Loops

**Build Phase (2-3 days)**
- Define Minimum Viable Feature (MVF)
- AI generates initial implementation
- Focus on core value proposition
- Skip nice-to-haves

**Measure Phase (1-2 days)**
- AI instruments code for metrics
- Automated data collection
- Performance monitoring
- User behavior tracking (even if user is just you)

**Learn Phase (1 day)**
- AI analyzes collected data
- Generates insights report
- Suggests pivots or improvements
- Updates hypothesis based on learning

**Practical Example:**
Building a CLI tool feature:
1. Build: Basic command that solves core problem
2. Measure: Track execution time, error rates, usage patterns
3. Learn: AI identifies that 80% of errors come from one input type
4. Pivot: Redesign input validation
5. Repeat cycle

### 3. Discovery-Driven Planning - Detailed Analysis

#### Assumption Mapping for Development

**Key Components:**

**1. Assumption Documentation**
```markdown
## Feature: Auto-save functionality

### Technical Assumptions:
- [ ] File system has sufficient write speed
- [ ] Users want saves every 30 seconds
- [ ] Conflict resolution is automatable

### User Assumptions:
- [ ] Users lose work frequently
- [ ] Auto-save won't interrupt workflow
- [ ] Storage space is not a concern

### Testing Milestones:
1. Prototype basic save mechanism (Day 2)
2. Test performance impact (Day 3)
3. User feedback on save frequency (Day 4)
```

**2. Milestone-Based Validation**
- Each milestone tests specific assumptions
- AI generates tests for each assumption
- Failing assumptions trigger immediate pivot
- Success criteria clearly defined

**3. Reverse Income Statement for Features**
- Start with desired outcome
- Work backwards to requirements
- Identify critical assumptions
- Test highest-risk assumptions first

### 4. Rapid Application Development - Detailed Analysis

#### AI-Powered RAD Cycles

**Phase 1: Requirements Planning (1 day)**
- Interactive AI session to gather requirements
- AI generates:
  - User stories
  - Technical requirements
  - Constraint identification
- Output: Living requirements document

**Phase 2: User Design/Prototyping (2-3 days)**
- AI creates multiple UI/UX options
- Rapid iteration on designs
- Interactive prototype generation
- User (you) provides immediate feedback

**Phase 3: Construction (3-5 days)**
- AI implements approved prototype
- Continuous integration and testing
- Real-time adjustments based on feedback
- Parallel development of features

**Phase 4: Cutover (1 day)**
- AI handles deployment automation
- Generates documentation
- Creates rollback procedures
- Monitors initial operation

## Hybrid Approaches: Best of Both Worlds

### The "Gated Sprint" Method

Combines phase gates with sprint methodology:

1. **Gate 0: Idea Validation** (30 minutes)
   - Quick feasibility check
   - AI estimates complexity
   - Go/No-Go decision

2. **Sprint 1: Proof of Concept** (3 days)
   - Rapid prototype
   - Core functionality only
   - Technical validation

3. **Gate 1: Technical Review** (1 hour)
   - Architecture assessment
   - Performance projections
   - Resource requirements

4. **Sprint 2: MVP Development** (5 days)
   - Full feature development
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Documentation

5. **Gate 2: Quality Review** (1 hour)
   - Code quality check
   - Test coverage review
   - Security assessment

6. **Sprint 3: Polish and Deploy** (2 days)
   - UI/UX refinements
   - Performance optimization
   - Deployment preparation

### The "Continuous Discovery" Method

Blends continuous delivery with discovery:

- **Weekly Hypothesis Cycles**
  - Monday: Form hypothesis
  - Tuesday-Thursday: Build and test
  - Friday: Learn and plan

- **Monthly Architecture Reviews**
  - Assess technical debt
  - Plan refactoring
  - Update documentation
