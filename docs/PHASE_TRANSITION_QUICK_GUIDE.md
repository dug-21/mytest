- Budget not approved
- Key requirements missing

### ❌ From Architecture → Implementation
- Design not reviewed
- APIs undefined
- Team not ready
- Dependencies unavailable

### ❌ From Implementation → Testing
- Features incomplete
- No test environment
- Critical bugs unfixed
- Documentation missing

### ❌ From Testing → Deployment
- Failing tests

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Document Everything**: Future you will thank present you
2. **Over-Communicate**: Transitions fail on assumptions
3. **Verify Twice**: Check deliverables before and after handoff
4. **Keep Artifacts**: Version control all transition documents
5. **Learn & Adapt**: Update templates based on experience
