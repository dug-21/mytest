# Salesforce Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

Salesforce is built on a multi-tenant cloud architecture that provides enterprise-grade CRM and platform capabilities. This analysis examines the architectural patterns, development approaches, and scalability considerations that make Salesforce unique in the enterprise software landscape.

## 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Benefits

**Resource Efficiency**
- Shared infrastructure reduces overall hardware and maintenance costs
- Automatic scaling based on aggregate demand
- Efficient resource utilization across all tenants

**Continuous Innovation**
- Single codebase means all customers receive updates simultaneously
- No version fragmentation or upgrade projects
- Reduced operational overhead for customers

**Built-in Best Practices**
- Security patches applied universally
- Performance optimizations benefit all tenants
- Standardized data model and processes

### Limitations

**Customization Constraints**
- Cannot modify core platform code
- Must work within platform boundaries
- Some deep customizations require creative workarounds

**Resource Contention**
- Shared resources mean governor limits are necessary
- Performance can be impacted by other tenants' activities
- Limited control over infrastructure scaling

**Data Isolation Concerns**
- While logically separated, data physically resides in shared databases
- Requires trust in Salesforce's security implementation
- Compliance challenges in highly regulated industries

## 2. Governor Limits and Performance

### Key Governor Limits

**Per-Transaction Limits**
```
- SOQL Queries: 100 (200 in async)
- DML Statements: 150
- CPU Time: 10,000 ms (60,000 ms async)
- Heap Size: 6 MB (12 MB async)
- Query Rows: 50,000
```

### Performance Implications

**Query Optimization**
- Selective queries are crucial (< 10-15% of records)
- Proper indexing strategy required
- Bulk operations preferred over row-by-row

**Architectural Patterns**
- Asynchronous processing for heavy operations
- Batch Apex for large data volumes
- Platform Events for decoupled architecture

**Best Practices**
- Bulkify all code
- Minimize database operations
- Use collection methods effectively
- Implement proper error handling

## 3. Security Model

### Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)

**Foundation Layer**
- Sets baseline access for each object
- Options: Private, Public Read Only, Public Read/Write
- Most restrictive setting recommended

### Sharing Mechanisms

**Role Hierarchy**
- Vertical access inheritance
- Manager sees subordinate's records
- Can be bypassed when needed

**Sharing Rules**
- Criteria-based sharing
- Ownership-based sharing
- Extends access beyond OWD

**Manual Sharing**
- Ad-hoc record sharing
- Programmatic sharing via Apex
- Team-based collaboration

### Access Control

**Profiles**
- Object-level permissions (CRUD)
- Field-level security
- System permissions
- Login restrictions

**Permission Sets**
- Additive permissions model
- Flexible assignment
- Better than profile proliferation

**Permission Set Groups**
- Bundle related permissions
- Easier management
- Role-based access control

## 4. Data Model and Relationships

### Relationship Types

**Lookup Relationships**
- Loosely coupled
- Optional relationships
- No cascade delete

**Master-Detail Relationships**
- Tightly coupled
- Roll-up summary fields
- Cascade delete
- Inherits sharing from master

**Many-to-Many (Junction Objects)**
- Connects two objects
- Enables complex relationships
- Reporting across relationships

### Data Architecture Considerations

**Schema Design**
- Denormalization often necessary
- Consider reporting requirements upfront
- Balance between flexibility and performance

**Large Data Volumes (LDV)**
- Skinny tables for frequently accessed fields
- Custom indexes for performance
- Archiving strategies
- External objects for truly massive datasets

## 5. Development Approaches Comparison

### Low-Code/No-Code Development

**Strengths**
- Rapid development and deployment
- Business user empowerment
- Lower technical debt
- Automatic upgrades
- Built-in security and compliance

**Use Cases**
- Standard CRM processes
- Simple workflows and approvals
- Basic integrations
- Reports and dashboards
- Page layouts and record types

**Tools**
- Process Builder / Flow
- Lightning App Builder
- Schema Builder
- Approval Processes
- Validation Rules

### Pro-Code Development

**Strengths**
- Complete control over logic
- Complex business requirements
- Performance optimization
- Advanced integrations
- Custom user interfaces

**Use Cases**
- Complex calculations
- Bulk data processing
- External system integration
- Custom APIs
- Advanced UI requirements

**Technologies**
- Apex (Java-like language)
- Lightning Web Components (LWC)
- Visualforce (legacy)
- SOQL/SOSL
- REST/SOAP APIs

### Decision Framework

**Choose Declarative When:**
- Requirements fit platform capabilities
- Maintenance by admins desired
- Rapid iteration needed
- Standard functionality sufficient

**Choose Programmatic When:**
- Complex logic required
- Performance is critical
- Integration complexity high
- Custom UI/UX needed

**Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
- Start declarative
- Enhance with code where needed
- Maintain clear boundaries
- Document transition points

## 6. Scalability Considerations

### Vertical Scaling

**Platform Limits**
- Storage: Varies by edition (10GB - unlimited)
- API Calls: 15,000 - unlimited daily
- Custom Objects: 200 - 2,000
- Users: No hard limit

**Performance Scaling**
- Platform automatically scales infrastructure
- Query optimization becomes critical
- Indexing strategy essential
- Asynchronous processing patterns

### Horizontal Scaling

**Data Partitioning**
- Divisions for large orgs
- Territory management
- Custom partitioning strategies

**Integration Patterns**
- Middleware for complex integrations
- Event-driven architecture
- Microservices approach
- CDC (Change Data Capture)

### Architectural Patterns for Scale

**Hub and Spoke**
- Salesforce as system of record
- Integrations to specialized systems
- Master data management

**Event-Driven Architecture**
- Platform Events
- Change Data Capture
- Streaming API
- Decoupled components

**Data Archiving**
- Big Objects for historical data
- External storage integration
- Compliance and retention policies

## 7. Best Practices and Recommendations
