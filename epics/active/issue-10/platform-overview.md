## Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Core Design Principles

Salesforce employs a sophisticated multi-tenant, metadata-driven architecture:

#### Multi-Tenancy Implementation
- **Single Database**: Shared multitenant database with unified schema
- **Tenant Isolation**: Each record includes tenant ID for complete data separation
- **Application Runtime**: Multitenant kernel dynamically serves tenant-specific applications
- **Query Security**: Automatic query predicates ensure data isolation

#### Metadata-Driven Model
- **No Code Compilation**: Changes are stored as metadata, not compiled code
- **No Physical Tables**: Object definitions exist as metadata, not database tables
- **Instant Updates**: Customizations available immediately without deployment
- **Private Metadata**: Each tenant's configurations are completely isolated
- **Zero Downtime**: Updates and customizations without system interruption

### 2025 Architecture Innovations

- Cloud-native relational database extending PostgreSQL
- Separates compute and storage layers
- Leverages Kubernetes for orchestration
- Cloud storage for unlimited scalability
- Tenant-specific features:
  - Per-tenant encryption
  - Isolated sandboxes
  - Tenant clustering in LSM structure

#### Scalability Features
- Unlimited cloud storage capacity
- Auto-scaling cache layers
- Expandable compute nodes
- Shared immutable storage
- No special networking or hardware requirements
