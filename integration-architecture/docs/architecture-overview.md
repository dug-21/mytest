# Architecture Overview

## Executive Summary

This integration architecture enables seamless communication between legacy community platforms, modern CRM systems, and various external services used by professional associations. The design emphasizes scalability, reliability, and maintainability while supporting both real-time and batch processing requirements.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- Web applications
- Mobile applications
- Third-party API consumers

### 2. API Gateway Layer
- Centralized API management
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- API versioning and routing

### 3. Integration Layer
- Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) for service orchestration
- Message queuing for asynchronous processing
- Event streaming for real-time updates
- ETL services for data transformation

### 4. Application Layer
- Legacy community platform (PHP/MySQL)
- Modern CRM platform
- Microservices for specific business functions

### 5. External Services Layer
- Payment processing
- Email marketing
- Learning management systems
- Certification bodies
- Continuing education providers

### 6. Data Layer
- Operational databases
- Data warehouse for analytics
- Data lake for unstructured data
- Caching layer for performance

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. API-First Architecture
All integrations are built on well-defined APIs with:
- RESTful design principles
- GraphQL for complex queries
- Webhook support for real-time events
- OpenAPI specifications

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- CQRS pattern for read/write separation
- Event streaming for real-time updates
- Eventual consistency model

### 3. Microservices Pattern
- Domain-driven design
- Service mesh for communication
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Independent deployment and scaling

### 4. Security Architecture
- Zero-trust security model
- OAuth2/OIDC for authentication
- API key management
- End-to-end encryption
- Regular security audits

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Synchronous Integration
- RESTful APIs for real-time queries
- GraphQL for complex data fetching
- Circuit breakers for fault tolerance

### 2. Asynchronous Integration
- Message queues for decoupling
- Event streaming for notifications
- Batch processing for large datasets

### 3. Hybrid Integration
- API Gateway routing logic
- Intelligent request handling
- Caching strategies
