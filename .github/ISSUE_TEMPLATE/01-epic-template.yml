        # üéØ Enhanced EPIC Template - Interface-Driven Development
        
        **This EPIC will use:**
        - **Living Documentation**: Updates tracked via "EPIC UPDATE:" comments
        - **Interface-First Design**: Mockups ‚Üí Interface Specs ‚Üí Architecture
        - **Phased Implementation**: AI-recommended phases at handoff
        - **Mandatory 5 Whys**: Deep problem analysis required

        ## üìã What Happens Next?
        
        1. **Phase 0**: AI analyzes feasibility and gathers initial research
        2. **Phase 1**: Mandatory 5 Whys analysis to find root problems
        3. **Phase 2**: Create mockups and extract interface specifications
        4. **Phase 3**: Design architecture to implement the interfaces
        5. **Phase 4**: Define detailed success criteria and acceptance tests
        6. **Phase 5**: AI recommends 2-4 implementation phases
        
        **Living Documentation**: Use "EPIC UPDATE:" comments to maintain current state
