        # ‚ùì 5 Whys Analysis Template
        
        **Purpose:** This helps us dig deeper into WHY we're building something and ensure we're solving the right problem.
        
        **For junior developers:** The 5 Whys technique was invented by Toyota to find root causes. We ask "why" 5 times to get to the heart of issues.

      placeholder: |
        **Question:** Why do users abandon the signup process?
        
        **Answer:** Because it takes too long and asks for too much information upfront.
        
        **Evidence:** Analytics show 60% drop-off after the first form page.

      placeholder: |
        **Question:** Why does asking for information upfront cause abandonment?
        
        **Answer:** Users don't trust us yet and don't want to share personal data before seeing value.
        
        **Evidence:** User interviews revealed trust concerns and "too much work" feedback.

      placeholder: |
        **Question:** Why don't users trust us during signup?
        
        **Answer:** Our brand is new and the signup form looks generic/suspicious.

      description: "Almost there..."
      placeholder: |
        **Question:** Why does our signup form look suspicious?

      placeholder: |
        **Question:** Why haven't we invested in signup UX and trust messaging?
        
        **Answer:** We prioritized feature development over conversion optimization.

      placeholder: |
        **Root Cause:** Lack of dedicated UX resources for the critical onboarding experience.

        **Insights:**
        ‚Ä¢ Technical solution alone won't fix the problem
        ‚Ä¢ Need UX design resources, not just engineering
        ‚Ä¢ Trust-building is as important as functionality
        ‚Ä¢ Progressive disclosure might be better than shorter forms
        
        **Implications for EPIC:**
        ‚Ä¢ Add UX designer to stakeholders
        ‚Ä¢ Include trust-building elements in scope
        ‚Ä¢ Consider phased rollout with A/B testing
        ‚Ä¢ Budget for professional design assets
